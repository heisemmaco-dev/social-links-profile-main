### What I learned

While this challenge didn't introduce new concepts, I used it to deepen my understanding of SCSS. One aspect I enjoyed was utilizing nesting for cleaner code:

```scss
// i enjoyed using nesting
article {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: rem(10);
  text-align: center;

  strong {
    color: $Green;
  }

  p {
    margin-top: rem(15);
    margin-bottom: rem(10);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

My focus is on further improving my use of SCSS to enhance frontend design.
